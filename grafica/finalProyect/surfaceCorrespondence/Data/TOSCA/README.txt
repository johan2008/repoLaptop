DESCRIPTION:

Hi-resolution three-dimensional nonrigid shapes in a variety of poses 
for non-rigid shape similarity and correspondence experiments. The database 
contains a total of 80 objects, including 11 cats, 9 dogs, 3 wolves, 8 horses,
4 gorillas, 12 female figures, and two different male figures, containing 7 
and 20 poses. The database also contains 6 centaurs for partial similarity 
experiments. Objects within the same class have the same triangulation and an 
equal number of vertices numbered in a compatible way. This can be used as
a per-vertex ground truth correspondence in correspondence experiments.
